## Tokenomics (v2)

**Supply Model:** Mintable (uncapped) for long-term club growth  
**Mint Authority:** 2-of-3 multisig (Treasury only; mints go to Treasury first)  
**Mint Cap:** New mints â‰¤ **10% of circulating supply** per rolling 12 months  
**Burn:** Contract burn / 0x...dEaD; target â‰ˆ **10% of net new annual mints**  
**Distribution:** Airdrops (500 ROC/member), rewards & events, time-locked Treasury  
**Taxes:** 0% transfer

### Minting Policy
- **Authority:** A **2-of-3 multisig Treasury** is the **only minter**.
- **Destination:** All new mints go to **Treasury** first (never to individuals directly).
- **Rate-Limit (Anti-Inflation Guardrail):**  
  In any rolling 12-month period, **New Mints â‰¤ 10% of CS** measured at the start of that window.  
  *Example:* If CS = 1,000,000 ROC on Jan 1, then total new mints from Jan 1â€“Dec 31 should be â‰¤ 100,000 ROC.
- **Change Management:** Any change to mint policy or caps is publicly announced with a **7-day cooldown** before taking effect.
- **Transparency:** Every mint txid, amount, and date are published below in **Mint/Burn Ledger** and are visible on-chain.

### Burn Policy
- **Mechanisms:**  
  - Contract burn (e.g., `burn(amount)` / `burnFrom(address, amount)`) **or**  
  - Proof-of-burn by sending to `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`.
- **Objective:** Offset inflation from new mints and aim for a **slight deflationary drift** over time.
- **Target Burn Rate:** Treasury **targets burning â‰ˆ 10% of net new annual mints** (same 12-month measurement window).
- **Reporting:** All burn txids and cumulative totals are published in the **Mint/Burn Ledger**.

### Allocations & Flows (Utility-only)
- **Member Airdrop:** 750 ROC per approved member (mint-on-demand from Treasury).
- **Rewards & Events:** Grants for community activities.
- **Treasury (with optional timelocks):** Operations and future utility.
- **(Future) Liquidity:** 0% initially; if enabled later, a public notice and separate policy will be published.

---

## Governance & Safety
- **Multisig:** All mint/burn/treasury actions require **2-of-3 approvals**.
- **Timelock (recommended):** 24â€“48 hours on mint transactions for public monitoring.
- **No Trading Taxes:** 0% to reduce friction and attack surface.
- **Renouncing/Freezing:** If the community opts for a fixed-supply regime later, minter rights can be revoked/renounced, and all usage will rely on existing Treasury balances.
